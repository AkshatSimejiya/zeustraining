HTML Introduction and Structure:

HTML is Hypertext Markup Language which is used to create web pages

HTML Block and Inline Elements:

Block elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space/margin before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available.

Inline elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.



Ways to apply CSS to HTML:

External CSS:
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file

Internal CSS:
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

Inline CSS:
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
